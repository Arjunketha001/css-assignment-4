justify-content:

This property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main axis (horizontally, in the case of a row, or vertically in the case of a column).
Possible values include flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, and space-evenly.

This property determines how the browser aligns items along the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main axis).
Values for this property include flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch.

align-self:

This property allows the individual items within the flex container to override the align-items property for their specific alignment.
It can take values like auto, flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch.

flex-direction:

This property establishes the main axis of the flex container, determining the direction in which the flex items are placed in the flex container.
Values include row (left to right), row-reverse (right to left), column (top to bottom), and column-reverse (bottom to top).

flex-wrap:

This property defines whether flex items are forced onto a single line or can wrap onto multiple lines along the cross-axis.
Values are nowrap (all items in one line), wrap (items can wrap onto multiple lines), and wrap-reverse (items wrap in reverse order).
