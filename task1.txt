CSS Flexbox:

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model, which means it deals with either rows or columns at a time.
It's well-suited for laying out items in a single direction, either horizontally or vertically.
It's great for creating flexible and dynamic layouts when the size of your items is unknown or variable.
CSS Grid:

Grid is a two-dimensional layout model, allowing you to define both rows and columns simultaneously.
It's designed for creating complex layouts with rows and columns, providing more control over the placement of items in both directions.
It's suitable for creating grid-based designs, such as those found in magazines or websites with a clear structure.
When to use one over the other:

Use Flexbox when:

You need to lay out items in a single direction (row or column).
The structure is more linear and less grid-like.
You want a simpler solution for distributing items along a single axis.
Use Grid when:

You need to create a two-dimensional layout with rows and columns.
You want precise control over the placement of items in both directions.
You are working with a more complex layout structure that resembles a grid.
